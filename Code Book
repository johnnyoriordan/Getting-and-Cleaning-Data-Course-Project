Modifications:

1. Assigning each data file to a variable name:
    features <- features.txt
    subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt
    x_test <- test/X_test.txt
    y_test <- test/y_test.txt
    subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt
    x_train <- test/X_train.txt
    y_train <- test/y_train.txt

2. Merging the training data sets and the test data sets to create one data frame called Merged_Data:
    X wasis created by merging x_train and x_test
    Y was is created by merging y_train and y_test
    Subject was created by merging subject_train and subject_test
    Merged_Data was created by merging Subject, Y and X


3. Extracting only the mean and standard deviation for each measurement:
    Mean_Std_Data was created by subsetting Merged_Data,
    selecting only the columns: subject and code,
    and the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.


4. Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:
    Numbers in code column of Mean_Std_Data were replaced with corresponding activity names taken from the second column of the activities variable.


5. Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names:
    code column in Mean_Std_Data renamed to activities
    All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
    All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
    All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
    All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
    All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
    All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time


6. Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject:
Tidy_Data was created by sumarizing Mean_Std_Data,
taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, 
after being grouped by subject and activity.
Tidy_Data was then exported as a txt. file.
