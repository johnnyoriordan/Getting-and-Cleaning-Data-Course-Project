This is my submission for the Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course. 

It includes an R script called run_analysis.R which does the following:

1. Downloads the dataset if it does not already exist in the working directory.
2. Assgins each data file to a variable
3. Merges the training data sets and test data sets into one data frame.
4. Creates a data frame containing the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
5. Gives the activities descriptive names.
6. Givies the variables appropriate descriptive names.
7. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The resulting data set is presented in the file Tidy_Data.txt
